        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello, I'm Isu Yi, a passionate individual with an unwavering love for basketball. From the moment I first held a basketball in my hands, the court became my sanctuary. Born to dribble, shoot, and score, I've spent countless hours perfecting my game. It's not just a sport for me; it's a way of life. The rhythmic sound of sneakers on the hardwood, the exhilaration of sinking a three-pointer, and the camaraderie on the court all fuel my basketball journey. Through the highs and lows, victories, and defeats, basketball has taught me resilience, teamwork, and the joy of pursuing my passion. On the court, I find my rhythm, my joy, and my identity.</p>

        <p>From the bustling streets to the echoing cheers of the court, my name is Isu Yi, and basketball has been my life's rhythmic heartbeat. Starting with makeshift hoops and a worn-out basketball, my journey began. I honed my skills in dusty playgrounds, dreaming of soaring through the air for a dunk or sinking a game-winning shot.</p>
